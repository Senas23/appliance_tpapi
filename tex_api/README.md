# tex_api
A Python client side utility for using Threat Extraction API calls to an appliance.

It includes Upload API calls, using the User-Check API format ( â€¦/UserCheck/TPAPI).

There's an option of using SSL certificate.

### The flow
Going through the input directory and handling each file in order to get its Threat Extraction results.

For each file:

> 1. Uploading the file to the appliance for handling by scrub (tex) feature.

>>> Using as default:  scrub-method=clean and a predefined least of scrubbed-parts-codes.
    
> 2. Writing scrub (tex) upload results into the output directory.
    
>>> If tex managed to clean the file, then also writing that cleaned file into the output directory.
    
### Usage
~~~~
python tex_api.py --help

usage: tex_api.py [-h] [-id INPUT_DIRECTORY] [-od OUTPUT_DIRECTORY]
                  [-ak API_KEY] [-ip APPLIANCE_IP] [-fq FQDN] [-ct CERT_FILE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -id INPUT_DIRECTORY, --input_directory INPUT_DIRECTORY
                        the input files folder to be scanned by TEX
  -od OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, --output_directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
                        the output folder with TEX results
  -ak API_KEY, --api_key API_KEY
                        the appliance api key
  -ip APPLIANCE_IP, --appliance_ip APPLIANCE_IP
                        the appliance ip address. If used, then cannot use
                        fqdn
  -fq FQDN, --fqdn FQDN
                        the appliance FQDN. If used, then cannot use
                        ip_address
  -ct CERT_FILE, --cert_file CERT_FILE
                        valid certificate file (full path), which matches the
                        appliance FQDN. If used, then must also use fqdn
